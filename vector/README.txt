# How to execute my program:
# I wrote a shell script to make an executable to compile my service.cpp
# Go to the command line and run " make " then run ./service  
# The program will read in everything from the text file then and store it in 
# A vector. (My datastore for the time being). After reading everything in 
# The developers will make a command to find out all the services most 
# customers spend their time and money so theyll know what places to continue to
# advertise.
